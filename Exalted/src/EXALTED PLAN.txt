What Happens Right Now:

- Can create Custom Exalts
- Can create custom Charms
- Can add Charms to Exalts
- User can explore charms further

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is Clunky:

- Making/Adding charms on Exalts is clunky
--Possibly implementing a Charm "Library" could help
- Typing the whole name of some charms is dumb
- creating exalts is hard due to amount of numbers required
- Printed character sheet can get lengthy
--Console is not permenant, look into GUI

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What comes next:

- Get charms to affect Exalts stats
-- This mostly affects permenant charms

- print health in a nice way
- handle combat
-- calculate soaks and weapons damages

- keep working on charm implementation
--including setup of MA and Sorcery
--- potential requirement for inheritance

- optimize AKA make this easier on myself
